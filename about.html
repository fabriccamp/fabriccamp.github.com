			<h4>A Bit Of History</h4>
                <p>The FabCamp story began in 2013 when a couple got the bug to start a business. Co-founder and CEO Riz was hard at work in a IT job that he says "didn't have a lot of heart" and was itching to do something entrepreneurial and meaningful. The idea of helping people create something and then receive it as a physical product they could touch and wear fit the bill for Riz. He contacted his better half (a fashion designer) Zeba and together they set about launching the company.</p> 
				<p>Riz spent long hours talking to Zeba and planning the business. The more they worked at it, the more convinced they became that getting custom t-shirts the traditional way was a pain-in-the-neck and that they could make it fun, easy, and reliable with a website. They officially founded FabCamp in Summer of 2013 and had soon assembled the rest of the early team. As the FabCamp team took shape, the one common denominator was heart: FabCamp attracted the kind of people who really care - the ones who get a bad feeling in the pit of their stomach if they think they're going to let someone down - and repelled those who didn't.</p> 
				<p>Our customers always have the last word, and that's how it should be.</p>

			<h4>Growth Spurts</h4>
                <p>Our product catalog has grown: in addition to hundreds of t-shirt styles and colors, we now offer customizable caps, hats, cups, mugs, jugs, platters and more...</p>
                <p>And we're continually expanding our services in response to your requests. You can order as little as one custom t-shirt at a time - perfect for gifts or self-expression.</p>
                <p>We love coming to work every day - we're among friends here, and we're challenged to innovate and take ownership over our work while being creative in our jobs and focusing our attention on making our customers happy. In short, we're inspired.</p>

			<h4>Inspiration</h4>
                <p>If we make a mistake, it has an impact - maybe one or two kids at the birthday party won't get to wear a shirt, and that's a big deal to us, because it's a big deal to you. It's not about numbers, it's about people.</p>
                <p>You'd think that running a successful business would be strictly about the bottom line. But the amazing thing is, it's not at all - actually caring about others and taking pride in our work through the core values, makes all the difference. We're inspired to do our best every day, and the bottom line takes care of itself.</p>
